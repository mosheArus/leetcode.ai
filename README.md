## Deliverables
- Full source code for the Chrome extension
  - manifest.json: Extension configuration with permissions and component definitions
  - content_script.js: Monitors LeetCode pages and extracts problem information
  - service_worker.js: Handles background processing, API calls to Hugging Face, and message passing
  - popup.html/popup.js: Provides the chat interface for interacting with the AI assistant
  - options.html/options.js: Handles user configuration settings

- Brief documentation explaining your approach, architecture decisions, and any assumptions made
  - **Architecture**: The extension follows a modular Manifest V3 design with clear separation of concerns:
    - Content script monitors LeetCode problem pages and extracts relevant information
    - Service worker manages communication between components and handles AI API integration
    - Popup provides the user interface for interacting with the AI assistant
  - **Key Features**:
    - Real-time problem detection on LeetCode pages
    - Dynamic DOM monitoring using MutationObserver to detect page changes
    - Secure communication with Hugging Face API for AI responses
    - Interactive chat interface for discussing problems and solutions
  - **Assumptions**:
    - Users need to have their own Hugging Face API key (configured in options)
    - Extension targets the current LeetCode UI structure as of development date
    - Internet connection is required for AI functionality

- Instructions for installation and testing
  1. **Installation**:
     - Clone the repository to your local machine
     - Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
     - Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in the top-right corner)
     - Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension directory
     - The extension icon should appear in your toolbar
  
  2. **Configuration**:
     - Click the extension icon and select the options/settings gear
     - Enter your Hugging Face API key in the designated field
     - Save your settings
  
  3. **Testing**:
     - Navigate to any LeetCode problem page (e.g., https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)
     - The extension will automatically detect the problem
     - Click the extension icon to open the chat interface
     - Ask questions about the problem or request help with solutions

- Short explanation of how you would extend this solution in the future
  - **Platform Expansion**: Extend support to other coding platforms like HackerRank, CodeSignal, and Codeforces
  - **Solution History**: Add functionality to save and retrieve past solutions and conversations
  - **Code Analysis**: Integrate capability to analyze user's code and provide specific optimization suggestions
  - **Offline Mode**: Implement caching of common problems/solutions for limited offline functionality
  - **UI/UX Improvements**: Develop a more sophisticated interface with syntax highlighting and code formatting
  - **Performance Optimization**: Improve extraction algorithms and reduce API call overhead
  - **Implement comprehensive error handling for API calls and DOM manipulation to gracefully manage smooth opreation
